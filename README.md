# Data-analytics-project
This is my take on the Google data analaytics capstone project. I will be following its guidlines excpet that the project I decided to work on isn't necessarily buisiness related. **Note that** this is my first project and first GitHub contribution. 

# Scenario
The final project of my psychology class in university was suggesting a hypothesis and gathering data to validate or invalidate it. Since the sample size was insufficent and the data was confined to a small geological area, I found the Google data analytics capstone case study to be a great oppurtunity to develop the project by adding public data to be analyzed, consequently (hopefully) gaining valuable insights from both data sources and also from comparing them side by side. 

# Ask 
In this part of the project we will be establshing a solid foundation foundation and addresing the key factors essential for the study.Achieiving this will be done n by answering the four following questions:  
[1. what is the topic to be investigated?](#the-topic)  
[2. who is the target audience?](#the-audience)
[3. what dataset is being analyzed?](#the-dataset)
[4. what are the metrics to be used?](the-metrics)
