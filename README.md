# Data-analytics-project
This is my take on the Google data analytics capstone project. I will be following its guidelines except that the project I decided to work on isn't necessarily business related. **Note that** this is my first project and first GitHub contribution. 

# Scenario
The final project of my psychology class in university was suggesting a hypothesis and gathering data to validate or invalidate it. Since the sample size was insufficient and the data was confined to a small geological area, I found the Google data analytics capstone case study to be a great opportunity to develop the project by adding public data to be analyzed, consequently (hopefully) gaining valuable insights from both data sources and also from comparing them side by side. 

# Ask 
In this part of the project we will be establishing a solid foundation foundation and addressing the key factors essential for the study.Achieving this will be done n by answering the four following questions:  
[1. what is the topic to be investigated?](#the-topic)  
[2. Who is the target audience?](#the-audience)  
[3. what dataset is being analyzed?](#the-dataset)  
[4. what are the metrics to be used?](the-metrics)  

### The topic
The hypothesis being tested is **Religiosity positively correlates with age". This suggests that as individuals grow old, their level of religiosity rises, excluding those who aren't old enough to form independent opinions and worldviews even if the trend still holds for them.  
investigating this hypothesis can help us uncover and understand societal trends regarding the dynamics of religiosity in different age groups over time.  

### The audience
The findings of this case study can benefit a number of entities and individuals mainly:  
**Academic researchers:** This study can serve as a basis for further academic research, contributing to the body of knowledge in fields such as sociology, psychology, and religious studies.  
**Advertisers:** Marketing algorithms can be designed with this correlation in mind helping market researchers, advertisers and corporations reach the right demographic consequently improving sales and user satisfaction.

### The dataset
To reach our objective we will use the following two datasets:  
**Dataset1**: For the previously mentioned phsycology project my colleague and I conducted an observation at a local mosque and at a local church during peak prayer time (mosque: Friday/ church: Sunday). We recorded the age of the attenders in the period of one day. you can find the raw data in the [raw-data-1] file
