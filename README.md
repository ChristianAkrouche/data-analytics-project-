# Data-analytics-project
This is my take on the Google data analaytics capstone project. I will be following its guidlines excpet that the project I decided to work on isn't necessarily buisiness related. **Note that** this is my first project and first GitHub contribution. 

# Scenario
The final project of my psychology class in university was suggesting a hypothesis and gathering data to validate or invalidate it. Since the sample size was insufficent and the data was confined to a small geological area, I found the Google data analytics capstone case study to be a great oppurtunity to develop the project by adding public data to be analyzed, consequently (hepefully) gaining valuable insights from both data sources and also from comparing them side by side.
